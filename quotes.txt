A PR to break RealSolarSystem into multiple pieces is opened and
then goes on for two months of back and forth, commiting and testing.
A new version of KSP is released and RSS switches engine.

All netkan indexing stops for a prolonged period (days).
The errors thrown are non-conclusive and the bots keep
getting stuck on what appears to be a very standard .netkan

It is truly amazing how many extensions to BDArmory are only compatible with a
KSP version that BDArmory is not compatible with.
