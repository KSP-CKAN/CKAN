easy-to-miss note I'm putting on my sandwich, don't eat it!". 
Windows is "I'm locking my sandwich in this safe. Why are you 
worried it will go stale?"

A PR to break RealSolarSystem into multiple pieces is opened and
then goes on for two months of back and forth, commiting and testing.
A new version of KSP is released and RSS switches engine.

All netkan indexing stops for a prolonged period (days).
The errors thrown are non-conclusive and the bots keep
getting stuck on what appears to be a very standard .netkan

(pjf) That's it!

It is truly amazing how many extensions to BDArmory are only compatible with a
KSP version that BDArmory is not compatible with.

<HebaruSan> It's crazy that an app has to specify which version of TLS to use to get an HTTPS URL
