From time to time mod authors ask their works be removed from the CKAN. Whether or not we should do this is a matter of licensing and public good. Our policy is based on two simple principles:

1. **The CKAN, like the legal system, takes licenses very seriously.**
1. **The CKAN acts in the interests of its users.**

Restrictive licenses, including the default "All Rights Reserved", allow the content author absolute control over what happens to their work. **If an All Rights Reserved or other restrictive license author asks for their mod to be de-indexed, we do so promptly and without question.**

Permissive licenses—which includes *every* license the CKAN is aware of that's not marked `restricted` or `unknown`, and includes the popular Creative Commons family of licenses—provide *explicit and irrevocable* permission to use and redistribute the content. Such a license is a strong, *legally binding* promise that the author cannot stop others from reproducing their work. One of the *primary purposes* of such a license is protection against the mod author changing their mind, or imposing further restrictions at a later date.

When an author gives us explicit and irrevocable permission via a legal document to redistribute their work, we cannot in good faith de-index the mod and still act in the interests of our users. **Whenever possible, mods with permissive licenses will be preserved by the CKAN**, especially when alternate downloads to such mods exist, including those cached by the CKAN's own automated systems.
