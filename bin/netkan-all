  IPC::System::Simple - Run commands simply, with detailed diagnostics
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system systemx capture capturex);
  
    system("some_command");        # Command succeeds or dies!
  
    system("some_command",@args);  # Succeeds or dies, avoids shell if @args
  
    systemx("some_command",@args); # Succeeds or dies, NEVER uses the shell
  
  
    # Capture the output of a command (just like backticks). Dies on error.
    my $output = capture("some_command");
  
    # Just like backticks in list context.  Dies on error.
    my @output = capture("some_command");
  
    # As above, but avoids the shell if @args is non-empty
    my $output = capture("some_command", @args);
  
    # As above, but NEVER invokes the shell.
    my $output = capturex("some_command", @args);
    my @output = capturex("some_command", @args);
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  Calling Perl's in-built C<system()> function is easy, 
  determining if it was successful is I<hard>.  Let's face it,
  C<$?> isn't the nicest variable in the world to play with, and
  even if you I<do> check it, producing a well-formatted error
  string takes a lot of work.
  
  C<IPC::System::Simple> takes the hard work out of calling 
  external commands.  In fact, if you want to be really lazy,
  you can just write:
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);
  
  and all of your C<system> commands will either succeed (run to
  completion and return a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic
  messages.
  
  The C<IPC::System::Simple> module also provides a simple replacement
  to Perl's backticks operator.  Simply write:
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);
  
  and then use the L</capture()> command just like you'd use backticks.
  If there's an error, it will die with a detailed description of what
  went wrong.  Better still, you can even use C<capturex()> to run the
  equivalent of backticks, but without the shell:
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(capturex);
  
      my $result = capturex($command, @args);
  
  If you want more power than the basic interface, including the
  ability to specify which exit values are acceptable, trap errors,
  or process diagnostics, then read on!
  
  =head1 ADVANCED SYNOPSIS
  
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(
      capture capturex system systemx run runx $EXITVAL EXIT_ANY
    );
  
    # Run a command, throwing exception on failure
  
    run("some_command");
  
    runx("some_command",@args);  # Run a command, avoiding the shell
  
    # Do the same thing, but with the drop-in system replacement.
  
    system("some_command");
  
    systemx("some_command", @args);
  
    # Run a command which must return 0..5, avoid the shell, and get the
    # exit value (we could also look at $EXITVAL)
  
    my $exit_value = runx([0..5], "some_command", @args);
  
    # The same, but any exit value will do.
  
    my $exit_value = runx(EXIT_ANY, "some_command", @args);
  
    # Capture output into $result and throw exception on failure
  
    my $result = capture("some_command");	
  
    # Check exit value from captured command
  
    print "some_command exited with status $EXITVAL\n";
  
    # Captures into @lines, splitting on $/
    my @lines = capture("some_command"); 
  
    # Run a command which must return 0..5, capture the output into
    # @lines, and avoid the shell.
  
    my @lines  = capturex([0..5], "some_command", @args);
  
  =head1 ADVANCED USAGE
  
  =head2 run() and system()
  
  C<IPC::System::Simple> provides a subroutine called
  C<run>, that executes a command using the same semantics is
  Perl's built-in C<system>:
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(run);
  
      run("cat *.txt");           # Execute command via the shell
      run("cat","/etc/motd");     # Execute command without shell
  
  The primary difference between Perl's in-built system and
  the C<run> command is that C<run> will throw an exception on
  failure, and allows a list of acceptable exit values to be set.
  See L</Exit values> for further information.
  
  In fact, you can even have C<IPC::System::Simple> replace the
  default C<system> function for your package so it has the
  same behaviour:
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);
  
      system("cat *.txt");  # system now suceeds or dies!
  
  C<system> and C<run> are aliases to each other.
  
  See also L</runx(), systemx() and capturex()> for variants of
  C<system()> and C<run()> that never invoke the shell, even with
  a single argument.
  
  =head2 capture()
  
  A second subroutine, named C<capture> executes a command with
  the same semantics as Perl's built-in backticks (and C<qx()>):
  
      use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);
  
      # Capture text while invoking the shell.
      my $file  = capture("cat /etc/motd");
      my @lines = capture("cat /etc/passwd");
  
  However unlike regular backticks, which always use the shell, C<capture>
  will bypass the shell when called with multiple arguments:
  
      # Capture text while avoiding the shell.
      my $file  = capture("cat", "/etc/motd");
      my @lines = capture("cat", "/etc/passwd");
  
  See also L</runx(), systemx() and capturex()> for a variant of
  C<capture()> that never invokes the shell, even with a single
  argument.
  
  =head2 runx(), systemx() and capturex()
  
  The C<runx()>, C<systemx()> and C<capturex()> commands are identical
  to the multi-argument forms of C<run()>, C<system()> and C<capture()>
  respectively, but I<never> invoke the shell, even when called with a
  single argument.  These forms are particularly useful when a command's
  argument list I<might> be empty, for example:
  
      systemx($cmd, @args);
  
  The use of C<systemx()> here guarantees that the shell will I<never>
  be invoked, even if C<@args> is empty.
  
  =head2 Exception handling
  
  In the case where the command returns an unexpected status, both C<run> and
  C<capture> will throw an exception, which if not caught will terminate your
  program with an error.
  
  Capturing the exception is easy:
  
      eval {
          run("cat *.txt");
      };
  
      if ($@) {
          print "Something went wrong - $@\n";
      }
  
  See the diagnostics section below for more details.
  
  =head3 Exception cases
  
  C<IPC::System::Simple> considers the following to be unexpected,
  and worthy of exception:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  Failing to start entirely (eg, command not found, permission denied).
  
  =item *
  
  Returning an exit value other than zero (but see below).
  
  =item *
  
  Being killed by a signal.
  
  =item *
  
  Being passed tainted data (in taint mode).
  
  =back
  
  =head2 Exit values
  
  Traditionally, system commands return a zero status for success and a
  non-zero status for failure.  C<IPC::System::Simple> will default to throwing
  an exception if a non-zero exit value is returned.
  
  You may specify a range of values which are considered acceptable exit
  values by passing an I<array reference> as the first argument.  The
  special constant C<EXIT_ANY> can be used to allow I<any> exit value
  to be returned.
  
  	use IPC::System::Simple qw(run system capture EXIT_ANY);
  
  	run( [0..5], "cat *.txt");             # Exit values 0-5 are OK
  
  	system( [0..5], "cat *.txt");          # This works the same way
  
  	my @lines = capture( EXIT_ANY, "cat *.txt"); # Any exit is fine.
  
  The C<run> and replacement C<system> subroutines returns the exit
  value of the process:
  
  	my $exit_value = run( [0..5], "cat *.txt");
  
  	# OR:
  
  	my $exit_value = system( [0..5] "cat *.txt");
  
  	print "Program exited with value $exit_value\n";
  
  =head3 $EXITVAL
  
  The exit value of any command executed by C<IPC::System::Simple>
  can always be retrieved from the C<$IPC::System::Simple::EXITVAL>
  variable:
  
  This is particularly useful when inspecting results from C<capture>,
  which returns the captured text from the command.
  
  	use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture $EXITVAL EXIT_ANY);
  
  	my @enemies_defeated = capture(EXIT_ANY, "defeat_evil", "/dev/mordor");
  
  	print "Program exited with value $EXITVAL\n";
  
  C<$EXITVAL> will be set to C<-1> if the command did not exit normally (eg,
  being terminated by a signal) or did not start.  In this situation an
  exception will also be thrown.
  
  =head2 WINDOWS-SPECIFIC NOTES
  
  As of C<IPC::System::Simple> v0.06, the C<run> subroutine I<when
  called with multiple arguments> will make available the full 32-bit
  exit value on Win32 systems.  This is different from the
  previous versions of C<IPC::System::Simple> and from Perl's
  in-build C<system()> function, which can only handle 8-bit return values.
  
  The C<capture> subroutine always returns the 32-bit exit value under
  Windows.  The C<capture> subroutine also never uses the shell,
  even when passed a single argument.
  
  Versions of C<IPC::System::Simple> before v0.09 would not search
  the C<PATH> environment variable when the multi-argument form of
  C<run()> was called.  Versions from v0.09 onwards correctly search
  the path provided the command is provided including the extension
  (eg, C<notepad.exe> rather than just C<notepad>, or C<gvim.bat> rather
  than just C<gvim>).  If no extension is provided, C<.exe> is
  assumed.
  
  Signals are not supported on Windows systems.  Sending a signal
  to a Windows process will usually cause it to exit with the signal
  number used.
  
  =head1 DIAGNOSTICS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item "%s" failed to start: "%s"
  
  The command specified did not even start.  It may not exist, or
  you may not have permission to use it.  The reason it could not
  start (as determined from C<$!>) will be provided.
  
  =item "%s" unexpectedly returned exit value %d
  
  The command ran successfully, but returned an exit value we did
  not expect.  The value returned is reported.
  
  =item "%s" died to signal "%s" (%d) %s
  
  The command was killed by a signal.  The name of the signal
  will be reported, or C<UNKNOWN> if it cannot be determined.  The
  signal number is always reported.  If we detected that the
  process dumped core, then the string C<and dumped core> is
  appended.
  
  =item IPC::System::Simple::%s called with no arguments
  
  You attempted to call C<run> or C<capture> but did not provide any
  arguments at all.  At the very lease you need to supply a command
  to run.
  
  =item IPC::System::Simple::%s called with no command
  
  You called C<run> or C<capture> with a list of acceptable exit values,
  but no actual command.
  
  =item IPC::System::Simple::%s called with tainted argument "%s"
  
  You called C<run> or C<capture> with tainted (untrusted) arguments, which is
  almost certainly a bad idea.  To untaint your arguments you'll need to pass
  your data through a regular expression and use the resulting match variables.
  See L<perlsec/Laundering and Detecting Tainted Data> for more information.
  
  =item IPC::System::Simple::%s called with tainted environment $ENV{%s}
  
  You called C<run> or C<capture> but part of your environment was tainted
  (untrusted).  You should either delete the named environment
  variable before calling C<run>, or set it to an untainted value
  (usually one set inside your program).  See
  L<perlsec/Cleaning Up Your Path> for more information.
  
  =item Error in IPC::System::Simple plumbing: "%s" - "%s"
  
  Implementing the C<capture> command involves dark and terrible magicks
  involving pipes, and one of them has sprung a leak.  This could be due to a
  lack of file descriptors, although there are other possibilities.
  
  If you are able to reproduce this error, you are encouraged
  to submit a bug report according to the L</Reporting bugs> section below.
  
  =item Internal error in IPC::System::Simple: "%s"
  
  You've found a bug in C<IPC::System::Simple>.  Please check to
  see if an updated version of C<IPC::System::Simple> is available.
  If not, please file a bug report according to the L</Reporting bugs> section
  below.
  
  =item IPC::System::Simple::%s called with undefined command
  
  You've passed the undefined value as a command to be executed.
  While this is a very Zen-like action, it's not supported by
  Perl's current implementation.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 DEPENDENCIES
  
  This module depends upon L<Win32::Process> when used on Win32
  system.  C<Win32::Process> is bundled as a core module in ActivePerl 5.6
  and above.
  
  There are no non-core dependencies on non-Win32 systems.
  
  =head1 COMPARISON TO OTHER APIs
  
  Perl provides a range of in-built functions for handling external
  commands, and CPAN provides even more.  The C<IPC::System::Simple>
  differentiates itself from other options by providing:
  
  =over 4
  
  =item Extremely detailed diagnostics
  
  The diagnostics produced by C<IPC::System::Simple> are designed
  to provide as much information as possible.  Rather than requiring
  the developer to inspect C<$?>, C<IPC::System::Simple> does the
  hard work for you.
  
  If an odd exit status is provided, you're informed of what it is.  If
  a signal kills your process, you are informed of both its name and
  number.  If tainted data or environment prevents your command from
  running, you are informed of exactly which datais 
  
  =item Exceptions on failure
  
  C<IPC::System::Simple> takes an aggressive approach to error handling.
  Rather than allow commands to fail silently, exceptions are thrown
  when unexpected results are seen.  This allows for easy development
  using a try/catch style, and avoids the possibility of accidently
  continuing after a failed command.
  
  =item Easy access to exit status
  
  The C<run>, C<system> and C<capture> commands all set C<$EXITVAL>,
  making it easy to determine the exit status of a command.
  Additionally, the C<system> and C<run> interfaces return the exit
  status.
  
  =item Consistent interfaces
  
  When called with multiple arguments, the C<run>, C<system> and
  C<capture> interfaces I<never> invoke the shell.  This differs
  from the in-built Perl C<system> command which may invoke the
  shell under Windows when called with multiple arguments.  It
  differs from the in-built Perl backticks operator which always
  invokes the shell.
  
  =back
  
  =head1 BUGS
  
  When C<system> is exported, the exotic form C<system { $cmd } @args>
  is not supported.  Attemping to use the exotic form is a syntax
  error.  This affects the calling package I<only>.  Use C<CORE::system>
  if you need it, or consider using the L<autodie> module to replace
  C<system> with lexical scope.
  
  Core dumps are only checked for when a process dies due to a
  signal.  It is not believed there are any systems where processes
  can dump core without dying to a signal.
  
  C<WIFSTOPPED> status is not checked, as perl never spawns processes
  with the C<WUNTRACED> option.
  
  Signals are not supported under Win32 systems, since they don't
  work at all like Unix signals.  Win32 singals cause commands to
  exit with a given exit value, which this modules I<does> capture.
  
  Only 8-bit values are returned when C<run()> or C<system()> 
  is called with a single value under Win32.  Multi-argument calls
  to C<run()> and C<system()>, as well as the C<runx()> and
  C<systemx()> always return the 32-bit Windows return values.
  
  =head2 Reporting bugs

  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module has only one function, which is also exported by default:
  
  =head2 subname NAME, CODEREF
  
  Assigns a new name to referenced sub.  If package specification is omitted in 
  the name, then the current package is used.  The return value is the sub.
  
  The name is only used for informative routines (caller, Carp, etc).  You won't 
  be able to actually invoke the sub by the given name.  To allow that, you need 
  to do glob-assignment yourself.
  
  Note that for anonymous closures (subs that reference lexicals declared outside 
  the sub itself) you can name each instance of the closure differently, which 
  can be very useful for debugging.

  =head1 NAME
  
  Try::Tiny - minimal try/catch with proper preservation of $@
  
  =head1 VERSION
  
  version 0.22
  
  =head1 SYNOPSIS
  
  You can use Try::Tiny's C<try> and C<catch> to expect and handle exceptional
  conditions, avoiding quirks in Perl and common mistakes:
  
    # handle errors with a catch handler
    try {
      die "foo";
    } catch {
      warn "caught error: $_"; # not $@
    };
  
  You can also use it like a standalone C<eval> to catch and ignore any error
  conditions.  Obviously, this is an extreme measure not to be undertaken
  lightly:
  
    # just silence errors
    try {
      die "foo";
    };
  
  =head1 DESCRIPTION
  
  This module provides bare bones C<try>/C<catch>/C<finally> statements that are designed to
  minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.
  
  This is unlike L<TryCatch> which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
  another call stack layer, and supports calling C<return> from the C<try> block to
  return from the parent subroutine. These extra features come at a cost of a few
  dependencies, namely L<Devel::Declare> and L<Scope::Upper> which are
  occasionally problematic, and the additional catch filtering uses L<Moose>
  type constraints which may not be desirable either.
  
  The main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error handling
  for those having a hard time installing L<TryCatch>, but who still want to
  write correct C<eval> blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.
  
  It's designed to work as correctly as possible in light of the various
  pathological edge cases (see L</BACKGROUND>) and to be compatible with any style
  of error values (simple strings, references, objects, overloaded objects, etc).
  
  If the C<try> block dies, it returns the value of the last statement executed in
  the C<catch> block, if there is one. Otherwise, it returns C<undef> in scalar
  context or the empty list in list context. The following examples all
  assign C<"bar"> to C<$x>:
  
    my $x = try { die "foo" } catch { "bar" };
    my $x = try { die "foo" } || { "bar" };
    my $x = (try { die "foo" }) // { "bar" };
  
    my $x = eval { die "foo" } || "bar";
  
  You can add C<finally> blocks, yielding the following:
  
    my $x;
    try { die 'foo' } finally { $x = 'bar' };
    try { die 'foo' } catch { warn "Got a die: $_" } finally { $x = 'bar' };
  
  C<finally> blocks are always executed making them suitable for cleanup code
  which cannot be handled using local.  You can add as many C<finally> blocks to a
  given C<try> block as you like.
  
  Note that adding a C<finally> block without a preceding C<catch> block
  suppresses any errors. This behaviour is consistent with using a standalone
  C<eval>, but it is not consistent with C<try>/C<finally> patterns found in
  other programming languages, such as Java, Python, Javascript or C#. If you
  learnt the C<try>/C<finally> pattern from one of these languages, watch out for
  this.
  
  =head1 EXPORTS
  
  All functions are exported by default using L<Exporter>.
  
  If you need to rename the C<try>, C<catch> or C<finally> keyword consider using
  L<Sub::Import> to get L<Sub::Exporter>'s flexibility.
  
  =over 4
  
  =item try (&;@)
  
  Takes one mandatory C<try> subroutine, an optional C<catch> subroutine and C<finally>
  subroutine.
  
  The mandatory subroutine is evaluated in the context of an C<eval> block.
  
  If no error occurred the value from the first block is returned, preserving
  list/scalar context.
  
  If there was an error and the second subroutine was given it will be invoked
  with the error in C<$_> (localized) and as that block's first and only
  argument.
  
  C<$@> does B<not> contain the error. Inside the C<catch> block it has the same
  value it had before the C<try> block was executed.
  
  Note that the error may be false, but if that happens the C<catch> block will
  still be invoked.
  
  Once all execution is finished then the C<finally> block, if given, will execute.
  
  =item catch (&;@)
  
  Intended to be used in the second argument position of C<try>.
  
  Returns a reference to the subroutine it was given but blessed as
  C<Try::Tiny::Catch> which allows try to decode correctly what to do
  with this code reference.
  
    catch { ... }
  
  Inside the C<catch> block the caught error is stored in C<$_>, while previous
  value of C<$@> is still available for use.  This value may or may not be
  meaningful depending on what happened before the C<try>, but it might be a good
  idea to preserve it in an error stack.
  
  For code that captures C<$@> when throwing new errors (i.e.
  L<Class::Throwable>), you'll need to do:
  
    local $@ = $_;
  
  =item finally (&;@)
  
    try     { ... }
    catch   { ... }
    finally { ... };
  
  Or
  
    try     { ... }
    finally { ... };
  
  Or even
  
    try     { ... }
    finally { ... }
    catch   { ... };
  
  Intended to be the second or third element of C<try>. C<finally> blocks are always
  executed in the event of a successful C<try> or if C<catch> is run. This allows
  you to locate cleanup code which cannot be done via C<local()> e.g. closing a file
  handle.
  
  When invoked, the C<finally> block is passed the error that was caught.  If no
  error was caught, it is passed nothing.  (Note that the C<finally> block does not
  localize C<$_> with the error, since unlike in a C<catch> block, there is no way
  to know if C<$_ == undef> implies that there were no errors.) In other words,
  the following code does just what you would expect:
  
    try {
      die_sometimes();
    } catch {
      # ...code run in case of error
    } finally {
      if (@_) {
        print "The try block died with: @_\n";
      } else {
        print "The try block ran without error.\n";
      }
    };
  
  B<You must always do your own error handling in the C<finally> block>. C<Try::Tiny> will
  not do anything about handling possible errors coming from code located in these
  blocks.
  
  Furthermore B<exceptions in C<finally> blocks are not trappable and are unable
  to influence the execution of your program>. This is due to limitation of
  C<DESTROY>-based scope guards, which C<finally> is implemented on top of. This
  may change in a future version of Try::Tiny.
  
  In the same way C<catch()> blesses the code reference this subroutine does the same
  except it bless them as C<Try::Tiny::Finally>.

  =head1 BACKGROUND
  
  There are a number of issues with C<eval>.
  
  =head2 Clobbering $@
  
  When you run an C<eval> block and it succeeds, C<$@> will be cleared, potentially
  clobbering an error that is currently being caught.
  
  This causes action at a distance, clearing previous errors your caller may have
  not yet handled.
  
  C<$@> must be properly localized before invoking C<eval> in order to avoid this
  issue.
  
  More specifically, C<$@> is clobbered at the beginning of the C<eval>, which
  also makes it impossible to capture the previous error before you die (for
  instance when making exception objects with error stacks).
  
  For this reason C<try> will actually set C<$@> to its previous value (the one
  available before entering the C<try> block) in the beginning of the C<eval>
  block.
  
  =head2 Localizing $@ silently masks errors
  
  Inside an C<eval> block, C<die> behaves sort of like:
  
    sub die {
      $@ = $_[0];
      return_undef_from_eval();
    }
  
  This means that if you were polite and localized C<$@> you can't die in that
  scope, or your error will be discarded (printing "Something's wrong" instead).
  
  The workaround is very ugly:
  
    my $error = do {
      local $@;
      eval { ... };
      $@;
    };
  
    ...
    die $error;
  
  =head2 $@ might not be a true value
  
  This code is wrong:
  
    if ( $@ ) {
      ...
    }
  
  because due to the previous caveats it may have been unset.
  
  C<$@> could also be an overloaded error object that evaluates to false, but
  that's asking for trouble anyway.
  
  The classic failure mode is:
  
    sub Object::DESTROY {
      eval { ... }
    }
  
    eval {
      my $obj = Object->new;
  
      die "foo";
    };
  
    if ( $@ ) {
  
    }
  
  In this case since C<Object::DESTROY> is not localizing C<$@> but still uses
  C<eval>, it will set C<$@> to C<"">.
  
  The destructor is called when the stack is unwound, after C<die> sets C<$@> to
  C<"foo at Foo.pm line 42\n">, so by the time C<if ( $@ )> is evaluated it has
  been cleared by C<eval> in the destructor.
  
  The workaround for this is even uglier than the previous ones. Even though we
  can't save the value of C<$@> from code that doesn't localize, we can at least
  be sure the C<eval> was aborted due to an error:
  
    my $failed = not eval {
      ...
  
      return 1;
    };
  
  This is because an C<eval> that caught a C<die> will always return a false
  value.
  
  =head1 SHINY SYNTAX
  
  Using Perl 5.10 you can use L<perlsyn/"Switch statements">.
  
  The C<catch> block is invoked in a topicalizer context (like a C<given> block),
  but note that you can't return a useful value from C<catch> using the C<when>
  blocks without an explicit C<return>.
  
  This is somewhat similar to Perl 6's C<CATCH> blocks. You can use it to
  concisely match errors:
  
    try {
      require Foo;
    } catch {
      when (/^Can't locate .*?\.pm in \@INC/) { } # ignore
      default { die $_ }
    };
  
  =head1 CAVEATS
  
  =over 4
  
  =item *
  
  C<@_> is not available within the C<try> block, so you need to copy your
  arglist. In case you want to work with argument values directly via C<@_>
  aliasing (i.e. allow C<$_[1] = "foo">), you need to pass C<@_> by reference:
  
    sub foo {
      my ( $self, @args ) = @_;
      try { $self->bar(@args) }
    }
  
  or
  
    sub bar_in_place {
      my $self = shift;
      my $args = \@_;
      try { $_ = $self->bar($_) for @$args }
    }
  
  =item *
  
  C<return> returns from the C<try> block, not from the parent sub (note that
  this is also how C<eval> works, but not how L<TryCatch> works):
  
    sub parent_sub {
      try {
        die;
      }
      catch {
        return;
      };
  
      say "this text WILL be displayed, even though an exception is thrown";
    }
  
  Instead, you should capture the return value:
  
    sub parent_sub {
      my $success = try {
        die;
        1;
      };
      return unless $success;
  
      say "This text WILL NEVER appear!";
    }
    # OR
    sub parent_sub_with_catch {
      my $success = try {
        die;
        1;
      }
      catch {
        # do something with $_
        return undef; #see note
      };
      return unless $success;
  
      say "This text WILL NEVER appear!";
    }
  
  Note that if you have a C<catch> block, it must return C<undef> for this to work,
  since if a C<catch> block exists, its return value is returned in place of C<undef>
  when an exception is thrown.
  
  =item *
  
  C<try> introduces another caller stack frame. L<Sub::Uplevel> is not used. L<Carp>
  will not report this when using full stack traces, though, because
  C<%Carp::Internal> is used. This lack of magic is considered a feature.
  
  =item *
  
  The value of C<$_> in the C<catch> block is not guaranteed to be the value of
  the exception thrown (C<$@>) in the C<try> block.  There is no safe way to
  ensure this, since C<eval> may be used unhygenically in destructors.  The only
  guarantee is that the C<catch> will be called if an exception is thrown.
  
  =item *
  
  The return value of the C<catch> block is not ignored, so if testing the result
  of the expression for truth on success, be sure to return a false value from
  the C<catch> block:
  
    my $obj = try {
      MightFail->new;
    } catch {
      ...
  
      return; # avoid returning a true value;
    };
  
    return unless $obj;
  
  =item *
  
  C<$SIG{__DIE__}> is still in effect.
  
  Though it can be argued that C<$SIG{__DIE__}> should be disabled inside of
  C<eval> blocks, since it isn't people have grown to rely on it. Therefore in
  the interests of compatibility, C<try> does not disable C<$SIG{__DIE__}> for
  the scope of the error throwing code.
  
  =item *
  
  Lexical C<$_> may override the one set by C<catch>.
  
  For example Perl 5.10's C<given> form uses a lexical C<$_>, creating some
  confusing behavior:
  
    given ($foo) {
      when (...) {
        try {
          ...
        } catch {
          warn $_; # will print $foo, not the error
          warn $_[0]; # instead, get the error like this
        }
      }
    }
  
  Note that this behavior was changed once again in L<Perl5 version 18
  |https://metacpan.org/module/perldelta#given-now-aliases-the-global-_>.
  However, since the entirety of lexical C<$_> is now L<considired experimental
  |https://metacpan.org/module/perldelta#Lexical-_-is-now-experimental>, it
  is unclear whether the new version 18 behavior is final.
